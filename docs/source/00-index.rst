About the User Manual
=====================
This user manual includes guidance for some of the day-to-day tasks that
may be required by an administrator (computer lab in-charge, teacher).
It is assumed that the administration has some basic knowledge of
working with a Linux distribution as the server is intended to be used
to teach the Linux subject in schools. Providing comprehensive server
administration guidance is outside the scope of this document.

We have created My sCool Server keeping in mind the “ease of use” so
quite a lot of tasks(not all of them) can be accomplished without having
to `RTFM <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RTFM>`_, however understanding that this device packs a lot of complex
technologies so to accomplish anything “under the hood” the
administrator must go through the instructions below at the minimum and
follow up reading the manuals provided by applications or online for
more details or tasks not covered here.
